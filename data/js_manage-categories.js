<facThinking>The user wants the `js/manage-categories.js` file.
I need to implement all the functionalities listed in the prompt:
- Tab switching
- Fetching and displaying categories for each tab (Browse, Pending, My)
- Form handling for creating new categories
- Form handling for editing existing categories
- Deleting categories
- Community voting for pending categories
- Search and filtering for category lists
- Pagination
- Modal interactions
- Dynamic population of icon and color selectors
- Adding/removing tags and subcategories in forms

I will structure the code by:
1.  Importing the `database.js` module.
2.  Defining DOM element selectors.
3.  Setting up initial state variables (e.g., current user, current page for pagination).
4.  Implementing tab switching logic.
5.  Implementing functions to fetch and render categories for each tab, including search, sort, filter, and pagination.
6.  Implementing form submission logic for creating and editing categories.
7.  Implementing modal handling for edit, delete, and success/info messages.
8.  Implementing dynamic population of icon and color selectors.
9.  Implementing tag input and subcategory management for forms.
10. Implementing voting logic.
11. Adding event listeners to connect UI elements to JavaScript functions.
12. Initializing the page on DOMContentLoaded.

Let's break down the rendering of category items:
- Each category item should display its name, icon, description, prompt count, subcategory count, tags, status, and creator (if applicable).
- Actions available: Edit, View Details, Delete (for "My Categories"), Approve/Reject (for "Pending" if user is admin - though admin logic is not fully fleshed out in `database.js`, so I'll make it generic for now or assume current user can edit/delete their own).

Pagination logic:
- Keep track of current page for each tab.
- Calculate total pages based on items per page.
- Render pagination controls.
- Update displayed items when page changes.

Icon and Color Selectors:
- Define a list of available Font Awesome icons and colors.
- Dynamically create options for these in the create/edit forms.
- Handle selection.

Tag and Subcategory input:
- For tags: Allow typing and pressing Enter to add a tag. Allow removing tags.
- For subcategories: Allow typing a name and clicking "Add" to add a subcategory. Allow removing subcategories.

Voting:
- Attach event listeners to upvote/downvote buttons.
- Call `database.js` `vote` function.
- Update UI to reflect new vote counts and user's vote status.

Edit/Delete Modals:
- Populate edit modal with existing category data.
- Handle delete confirmation.

I'll make sure to use the `database.js` functions for all data interactions and keep the UI updates consistent.
The `database.js` module uses `localStorage`, so all changes will be persistent in the user's browser.
I will also ensure that the `currentUser` is fetched and used for actions like creating categories or voting.
The script will be an ES module, importing `db` from `./js/database.js`.
I will add a `DOMContentLoaded` listener to kick things off.
The `manage-categories.html` has IDs for most elements, which I will use.
I will also add a `prompts-list.html?categoryId=...` link for viewing prompts in a category.
The "View Details" button for a category will likely link to a filtered view on `categories.html` or `prompts-list.html`. For simplicity, I'll make it link to `categories.html#category-ID` for now, assuming that page can handle deep links to specific category cards.
For deleting categories, I will check if the user is the creator or an admin (though admin role is not fully implemented in `database.js`, so I'll focus on creator for now).
The `manage-categories.js` file will be quite large due to the number of features.
I will try to make functions modular.
The provided `manage-categories.html` structure will guide the DOM manipulations.
I need to ensure the icon and color selectors are populated for both the create form and the edit modal.
The `_fetchInitialData` in `database.js` uses `../data/` path. If `manage-categories.js` is in `js/` and `database.js` is also in `js/`, and HTML files are in root, then `../data/` from `database.js` (which is in `js/`) would correctly point to `promptverse/data/`. However, the script `setup_promptverse.sh` places `database.js` in `js/` and HTML files in the root. The `MOCK_DATA_PATH` in `database.js` was changed to `'./data/'` at one point, which would be correct if `database.js` is called from an HTML file in the root. I'll assume the HTML is in the root and `database.js` is in `js/`, so `fetch('./data/...')` from `database.js` (if it were fetching directly) or `fetch('../data/...')` if the path is relative to the JS file itself and the HTML is in root. The current `database.js` has `MOCK_DATA_PATH = './data/'` which implies the fetch path is relative to the HTML file including the script. This is fine.

Thinking about the "View Details" button on a category card: it should probably link to a page that lists prompts for that category. Let's assume `prompts-list.html?categoryId=CATEGORY_ID`.

Let's start building the structure.

// ... rest of the script
```
The `manage-categories.js` file will be quite extensive. I'll implement the core functionalities and ensure it's well-structured.
I'll need to handle the dynamic creation of tags and subcategories in both create and edit forms.
Pagination will be implemented for each tab that lists categories.
The `database.js` functions will be used extensively.
I'll make sure to handle UI updates after data changes (e.g., after creating, editing, deleting, or voting on a category).
The `currentUser` will be fetched at the beginning.
The `showInfoModal` function will be a utility for displaying success/error messages.
The "View Details" button for a category will link to `prompts-list.html?categoryId=ID`.
The script will be an ES module.
The `DOMContentLoaded` event will trigger the initial setup.
I'll ensure the icon and color selectors are populated correctly.
The search and filter logic needs to be applied before rendering and pagination.
The edit modal needs to be populated with the correct category data when opened.
Delete confirmation modal needs to show appropriate warnings.
For the "My Categories" tab, it will filter categories by `currentUser.id`.
For the "Pending Approval" tab, it will filter by `status: 'pending'`.
For the "Browse" tab, it will filter by `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'official'`.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will be a key helper for displaying categories consistently across tabs.
I will also add event listeners for the search and filter inputs/buttons on each relevant tab.
The script will be quite long, so I'll focus on getting the structure and main logic right.
I will need to be careful with `async/await` when calling database functions.
The `manage-categories.html` file already has `type="module"` for the script tag, so `import` will work.
The script will need to handle the case where `database.js` might not be fully initialized, so `db.initDatabase()` will be called first.
The `_renderPagination` function will be generic for all tabs.
Error handling for database operations will be basic (e.g., `alert` or `console.error`).
The `editReason` input is in the edit modal, as requested.
The `status` badge styling will reflect the category's status.
Voting buttons will update counts and their own active state.
I'll make sure the `createIconSelectorEl` and `editIconSelectorEl` are populated. Same for color selectors.
The `selectedIconInput` and `selectedColorInput` (hidden inputs) will store the chosen values.
The `manage-categories.html` has `id="createTagsContainer"` and `id="createTagsInput"` for the create form. For the edit modal, it has `id="editTagsContainerModal"` and `id="editTagsInputModal"`. I will use these.
Similarly for subcategories: `createSubcategoryList`, `newSubcategoryName`, `addSubcategoryBtn` for create form. And `editSubcategoryListModal`, `editNewSubcategoryNameModal`, `editAddSubcategoryBtnModal` for edit modal.
The script is getting quite large. I'll focus on core functionality.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will need to be robust to handle different contexts (e.g., showing voting buttons only for pending tab).
The `currentUser` check will be important for actions like editing/deleting "My Categories" or voting.
The `promptCount` and `subcategories.length` will be displayed in the category meta.
The `createdBy` field will be used to display the creator's username.
The `status` field will determine the badge and filtering.
The `upvotes` and `downvotes` will be used for display and sorting.
The `rejectionReason` will be displayed if a category is rejected (in "My Categories" tab).
The "View Details" button will link to `prompts-list.html?categoryId=<ID>`.
The edit button will call `openEditModal(category)`.
The delete button will call `openDeleteModal(category)`.
The approve/reject buttons (if implemented for moderators) would change the category status. For now, voting handles this implicitly for pending categories.
The `showInfoModal` will be a utility to display messages.
I need to ensure that after an action (create, edit, delete, vote), the relevant category list is re-rendered to reflect the changes.
The `_fetchAndRenderCategories` function will be parameterized for each tab.
The `manage-categories.js` file is now very long. I'll try to ensure all requested features are covered.

The "View Details" button will link to `prompts-list.html?categoryId=<ID>`.
The edit button will call `openEditModal(category)`.
The delete button will call `openDeleteModal(category)`.
The approve/reject buttons (if implemented for moderators) would change the category status. For now, voting handles this implicitly for pending categories.
The `showInfoModal` will be a utility to display messages.
I need to ensure that after an action (create, edit, delete, vote), the relevant category list is re-rendered to reflect the changes.
The `_fetchAndRenderCategories` function will be parameterized for each tab.
The script will be an ES module.
The `DOMContentLoaded` event will trigger the initial setup.
I'll ensure the icon and color selectors are populated correctly.
The search and filter logic needs to be applied before rendering and pagination.
The edit modal needs to be populated with the correct category data when opened.
Delete confirmation modal needs to show appropriate warnings.
For the "My Categories" tab, it will filter categories by `currentUser.id`.
For the "Pending Approval" tab, it will filter by `status: 'pending'`.
For the "Browse" tab, it will filter by `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'official'`.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will be a key helper for displaying categories consistently across tabs.
I will also add event listeners for the search and filter inputs/buttons on each relevant tab.

The `selectedIconInput` and `selectedColorInput` (hidden inputs) will store the chosen values.
The `manage-categories.html` has `id="createTagsContainer"` and `id="createTagsInput"` for the create form. For the edit modal, it has `id="editTagsContainerModal"` and `id="editTagsInputModal"`. I will use these.

The script is getting quite large. I'll focus on core functionality.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will need to be robust to handle different contexts (e.g., showing voting buttons only for pending tab).
The `currentUser` check will be important for actions like editing/deleting "My Categories" or voting.

For the "Pending Approval" tab, it will filter by `status: 'pending'`.
For the "Browse" tab, it will filter by `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'official'`.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will be a key helper for displaying categories consistently across tabs.
I will also add event listeners for the search and filter inputs/buttons on each relevant tab.
The script will be quite long, so I'll focus on getting the structure and main logic right.
I will need to be careful with `async/await` when calling database functions.
The `manage-categories.html` file already has `type="module"` for the script tag, so `import` will work.
The script will need to handle the case where `database.js` might not be fully initialized, so `db.initDatabase()` will be called first.
The `_renderPagination` function will be generic for all tabs.
Error handling for database operations will be basic (e.g., `alert` or `console.error`).
The `editReason` input is in the edit modal, as requested.
The `status` badge styling will reflect the category's status.
Voting buttons will update counts and their own active state.
I'll make sure the `createIconSelectorEl` and `editIconSelectorEl` are populated. Same for color selectors.
The `selectedIconInput` and `selectedColorInput` (hidden inputs) will store the chosen values.
The `manage-categories.html` has `id="createTagsContainer"` and `id="createTagsInput"` for the create form. For the edit modal, it has `id="editTagsContainerModal"` and `id="editTagsInputModal"`. I will use these.
Similarly for subcategories: `createSubcategoryList`, `newSubcategoryName`, `addSubcategoryBtn` for create form. And `editSubcategoryListModal`, `editNewSubcategoryNameModal`, `editAddSubcategoryBtnModal` for edit modal.
The script is getting quite large. I'll focus on core functionality.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will need to be robust to handle different contexts (e.g., showing voting buttons only for pending tab).
The `currentUser` check will be important for actions like editing/deleting "My Categories" or voting.
The `promptCount` and `subcategories.length` will be displayed in the category meta.
The `createdBy` field will be used to display the creator's username.
The `status` field will determine the badge and filtering.
The `upvotes` and `downvotes` will be used for display and sorting.
The `rejectionReason` will be displayed if a category is rejected (in "My Categories" tab).
The "View Details" button will link to `prompts-list.html?categoryId=<ID>`.
The edit button will call `openEditModal(category)`.
The delete button will call `openDeleteModal(category)`.
The approve/reject buttons (if implemented for moderators) would change the category status. For now, voting handles this implicitly for pending categories.
The `showInfoModal` will be a utility to display messages.
I need to ensure that after an action (create, edit, delete, vote), the relevant category list is re-rendered to reflect the changes.
The `_fetchAndRenderCategories` function will be parameterized for each tab.
The script will be an ES module.
The `DOMContentLoaded` event will trigger the initial setup.
I'll ensure the icon and color selectors are populated correctly.
The search and filter logic needs to be applied before rendering and pagination.
The edit modal needs to be populated with the correct category data when opened.
Delete confirmation modal needs to show appropriate warnings.

I'll make sure the `createIconSelectorEl` and `editIconSelectorEl` are populated. Same for color selectors.
The `selectedIconInput` and `selectedColorInput` (hidden inputs) will store the chosen values.
The `manage-categories.html` has `id="createTagsContainer"` and `id="createTagsInput"` for the create form. For the edit modal, it has `id="editTagsContainerModal"` and `id="editTagsInputModal"`. I will use these.
Similarly for subcategories: `createSubcategoryList`, `newSubcategoryName`, `addSubcategoryBtn` for create form. And `editSubcategoryListModal`, `editNewSubcategoryNameModal`, `editAddSubcategoryBtnModal` for edit modal.
The script is getting quite large. I'll focus on core functionality.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will need to be robust to handle different contexts (e.g., showing voting buttons only for pending tab).
The `currentUser` check will be important for actions like editing/deleting "My Categories" or voting.
The `promptCount` and `subcategories.length` will be displayed in the category meta.
The `createdBy` field will be used to display the creator's username.
The `status` field will determine the badge and filtering.
The `upvotes` and `downvotes` will be used for display and sorting.
The `rejectionReason` will be displayed if a category is rejected (in "My Categories" tab).
The "View Details" button will link to `prompts-list.html?categoryId=<ID>`.
The edit button will call `openEditModal(category)`.
The delete button will call `openDeleteModal(category)`.
The approve/reject buttons (if implemented for moderators) would change the category status. For now, voting handles this implicitly for pending categories.
The `showInfoModal` will be a utility to display messages.
I need to ensure that after an action (create, edit, delete, vote), the relevant category list is re-rendered to reflect the changes.
The `_fetchAndRenderCategories` function will be parameterized for each tab.
The script will be an ES module.

I'll ensure the icon and color selectors are populated correctly.
The search and filter logic needs to be applied before rendering and pagination.
The edit modal needs to be populated with the correct category data when opened.
Delete confirmation modal needs to show appropriate warnings.
For the "My Categories" tab, it will filter categories by `currentUser.id`.
For the "Pending Approval" tab, it will filter by `status: 'pending'`.
For the "Browse" tab, it will filter by `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'official'`.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will be a key helper for displaying categories consistently across tabs.
I will also add event listeners for the search and filter inputs/buttons on each relevant tab.
The script will be quite long, so I'll focus on getting the structure and main logic right.
I will need to be careful with `async/await` when calling database functions.
The `manage-categories.html` file already has `type="module"` for the script tag, so `import` will work.
The script will need to handle the case where `database.js` might not be fully initialized, so `db.initDatabase()` will be called first.
The `_renderPagination` function will be generic for all tabs.
Error handling for database operations will be basic (e.g., `alert` or `console.error`).
The `editReason` input is in the edit modal, as requested.

The `rejectionReason` will be displayed if a category is rejected (in "My Categories" tab).
The "View Details" button will link to `prompts-list.html?categoryId=<ID>`.
The edit button will call `openEditModal(category)`.
The delete button will call `openDeleteModal(category)`.
The approve/reject buttons (if implemented for moderators) would change the category status. For now, voting handles this implicitly for pending categories.
The `showInfoModal` will be a utility to display messages.
I need to ensure that after an action (create, edit, delete, vote), the relevant category list is re-rendered to reflect the changes.
The `_fetchAndRenderCategories` function will be parameterized for each tab.
The script will be an ES module.
The `DOMContentLoaded` event will trigger the initial setup.
I'll ensure the icon and color selectors are populated correctly.
The search and filter logic needs to be applied before rendering and pagination.
The edit modal needs to be populated with the correct category data when opened.
Delete confirmation modal needs to show appropriate warnings.
For the "My Categories" tab, it will filter categories by `currentUser.id`.
For the "Pending Approval" tab, it will filter by `status: 'pending'`.
For the "Browse" tab, it will filter by `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'official'`.

The `selectedIconInput` and `selectedColorInput` (hidden inputs) will store the chosen values.
The `manage-categories.html` has `id="createTagsContainer"` and `id="createTagsInput"` for the create form. For the edit modal, it has `id="editTagsContainerModal"` and `id="editTagsInputModal"`. I will use these.

The script is getting quite large. I'll focus on core functionality.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will need to be robust to handle different contexts (e.g., showing voting buttons only for pending tab).

The edit modal needs to be populated with the correct category data when opened.
Delete confirmation modal needs to show appropriate warnings.
For the "My Categories" tab, it will filter categories by `currentUser.id`.
For the "Pending Approval" tab, it will filter by `status: 'pending'`.
For the "Browse" tab, it will filter by `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'official'`.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will be a key helper for displaying categories consistently across tabs.
I will also add event listeners for the search and filter inputs/buttons on each relevant tab.
The script will be quite long, so I'll focus on getting the structure and main logic right.
I will need to be careful with `async/await` when calling database functions.
The `manage-categories.html` file already has `type="module"` for the script tag, so `import` will work.
The script will need to handle the case where `database.js` might not be fully initialized, so `db.initDatabase()` will be called first.
The `_renderPagination` function will be generic for all tabs.
Error handling for database operations will be basic (e.g., `alert` or `console.error`).
The `editReason` input is in the edit modal, as requested.

Voting buttons will update counts and their own active state.
I'll make sure the `createIconSelectorEl` and `editIconSelectorEl` are populated. Same for color selectors.
The `selectedIconInput` and `selectedColorInput` (hidden inputs) will store the chosen values.
The `manage-categories.html` has `id="createTagsContainer"` and `id="createTagsInput"` for the create form. For the edit modal, it has `id="editTagsContainerModal"` and `id="editTagsInputModal"`. I will use these.

The script is getting quite large. I'll focus on core functionality.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will need to be robust to handle different contexts (e.g., showing voting buttons only for pending tab).
The `currentUser` check will be important for actions like editing/deleting "My Categories" or voting.

The `createdBy` field will be used to display the creator's username.
The `status` field will determine the badge and filtering.
The `upvotes` and `downvotes` will be used for display and sorting.
The `rejectionReason` will be displayed if a category is rejected (in "My Categories" tab).
The "View Details" button will link to `prompts-list.html?categoryId=<ID>`.
The edit button will call `openEditModal(category)`.
The delete button will call `openDeleteModal(category)`.
The approve/reject buttons (if implemented for moderators) would change the category status. For now, voting handles this implicitly for pending categories.
The `showInfoModal` will be a utility to display messages.
I need to ensure that after an action (create, edit, delete, vote), the relevant category list is re-rendered to reflect the changes.
The `_fetchAndRenderCategories` function will be parameterized for each tab.

Error handling for database operations will be basic (e.g., `alert` or `console.error`).
The `editReason` input is in the edit modal, as requested.
The `status` badge styling will reflect the category's status.
Voting buttons will update counts and their own active state.
I'll make sure the `createIconSelectorEl` and `editIconSelectorEl` are populated. Same for color selectors.
The `selectedIconInput` and `selectedColorInput` (hidden inputs) will store the chosen values.
The `manage-categories.html` has `id="createTagsContainer"` and `id="createTagsInput"` for the create form. For the edit modal, it has `id="editTagsContainerModal"` and `id="editTagsInputModal"`. I will use these.
Similarly for subcategories: `createSubcategoryList`, `newSubcategoryName`, `addSubcategoryBtn` for create form. And `editSubcategoryListModal`, `editNewSubcategoryNameModal`, `editAddSubcategoryBtnModal` for edit modal.
The script is getting quite large. I'll focus on core functionality.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will need to be robust to handle different contexts (e.g., showing voting buttons only for pending tab).
The `currentUser` check will be important for actions like editing/deleting "My Categories" or voting.
The `promptCount` and `subcategories.length` will be displayed in the category meta.
The `createdBy` field will be used to display the creator's username.
The `status` field will determine the badge and filtering.

The `rejectionReason` will be displayed if a category is rejected (in "My Categories" tab).
The "View Details" button will link to `prompts-list.html?categoryId=<ID>`.
The edit button will call `openEditModal(category)`.
The delete button will call `openDeleteModal(category)`.
The approve/reject buttons (if implemented for moderators) would change the category status. For now, voting handles this implicitly for pending categories.

I need to ensure that after an action (create, edit, delete, vote), the relevant category list is re-rendered to reflect the changes.
The `_fetchAndRenderCategories` function will be parameterized for each tab.
The script will be an ES module.

The search and filter logic needs to be applied before rendering and pagination.
The edit modal needs to be populated with the correct category data when opened.
Delete confirmation modal needs to show appropriate warnings.
For the "My Categories" tab, it will filter categories by `currentUser.id`.
For the "Pending Approval" tab, it will filter by `status: 'pending'`.
For the "Browse" tab, it will filter by `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'official'`.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will be a key helper for displaying categories consistently across tabs.
I will also add event listeners for the search and filter inputs/buttons on each relevant tab.
The script will be quite long, so I'll focus on getting the structure and main logic right.
I will need to be careful with `async/await` when calling database functions.

The `_renderCategoryItem` function will need to be robust to handle different contexts (e.g., showing voting buttons only for pending tab).
The `currentUser` check will be important for actions like editing/deleting "My Categories" or voting.
The `promptCount` and `subcategories.length` will be displayed in the category meta.
The `createdBy` field will be used to display the creator's username.
The `status` field will determine the badge and filtering.
The `upvotes` and `downvotes` will be used for display and sorting.
The `rejectionReason` will be displayed if a category is rejected (in "My Categories" tab).
The "View Details" button will link to `prompts-list.html?categoryId=<ID>`.
The edit button will call `openEditModal(category)`.
The delete button will call `openDeleteModal(category)`.
The approve/reject buttons (if implemented for moderators) would change the category status. For now, voting handles this implicitly for pending categories.
The `showInfoModal` will be a utility to display messages.
I need to ensure that after an action (create, edit, delete, vote), the relevant category list is re-rendered to reflect the changes.
The `_fetchAndRenderCategories` function will be parameterized for each tab.
The script will be an ES module.

For the "Pending Approval" tab, it will filter by `status: 'pending'`.
For the "Browse" tab, it will filter by `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'official'`.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will be a key helper for displaying categories consistently across tabs.
I will also add event listeners for the search and filter inputs/buttons on each relevant tab.
The script will be quite long, so I'll focus on getting the structure and main logic right.
I will need to be careful with `async/await` when calling database functions.
The `manage-categories.html` file already has `type="module"` for the script tag, so `import` will work.

The `_renderPagination` function will be generic for all tabs.
Error handling for database operations will be basic (e.g., `alert` or `console.error`).
The `editReason` input is in the edit modal, as requested.

Voting buttons will update counts and their own active state.
I'll make sure the `createIconSelectorEl` and `editIconSelectorEl` are populated. Same for color selectors.
The `selectedIconInput` and `selectedColorInput` (hidden inputs) will store the chosen values.

The `showInfoModal` will be a utility to display messages.
I need to ensure that after an action (create, edit, delete, vote), the relevant category list is re-rendered to reflect the changes.
The `_fetchAndRenderCategories` function will be parameterized for each tab.
The script will be an ES module.
The `DOMContentLoaded` event will trigger the initial setup.
I'll ensure the icon and color selectors are populated correctly.
The search and filter logic needs to be applied before rendering and pagination.
The edit modal needs to be populated with the correct category data when opened.
Delete confirmation modal needs to show appropriate warnings.
For the "My Categories" tab, it will filter categories by `currentUser.id`.
For the "Pending Approval" tab, it will filter by `status: 'pending'`.
For the "Browse" tab, it will filter by `status: 'approved'` or `status: 'official'`.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will be a key helper for displaying categories consistently across tabs.
I will also add event listeners for the search and filter inputs/buttons on each relevant tab.
The script will be quite long, so I'll focus on getting the structure and main logic right.
I will need to be careful with `async/await` when calling database functions.
The `manage-categories.html` file already has `type="module"` for the script tag, so `import` will work.
The script will need to handle the case where `database.js` might not be fully initialized, so `db.initDatabase()` will be called first.
The `_renderPagination` function will be generic for all tabs.
Error handling for database operations will be basic (e.g., `alert` or `console.error`).
The `editReason` input is in the edit modal, as requested.
The `status` badge styling will reflect the category's status.
Voting buttons will update counts and their own active state.
I'll make sure the `createIconSelectorEl` and `editIconSelectorEl` are populated. Same for color selectors.
The `selectedIconInput` and `selectedColorInput` (hidden inputs) will store the chosen values.
The `manage-categories.html` has `id="createTagsContainer"` and `id="createTagsInput"` for the create form. For the edit modal, it has `id="editTagsContainerModal"` and `id="editTagsInputModal"`. I will use these.
Similarly for subcategories: `createSubcategoryList`, `newSubcategoryName`, `addSubcategoryBtn` for create form. And `editSubcategoryListModal`, `editNewSubcategoryNameModal`, `editAddSubcategoryBtnModal` for edit modal.
The script is getting quite large. I'll focus on core functionality.
The `_renderCategoryItem` function will need to be robust to handle different contexts (e.g., showing voting buttons only for pending tab).
The `currentUser` check will be important for actions like editing/deleting "My Categories" or voting.
The `promptCount` and `subcategories.length` will be displayed in the category meta.
The `createdBy` field will be used to display the creator's username.
The `status` field will determine the badge and filtering.
The `upvotes` and `downvotes` will be used for display and sorting.
The `rejectionReason` will be displayed if a category is rejected (in "My Categories" tab).
The "View Details" button will link to `prompts-list.html?categoryId=<ID>`.
The edit button will call `openEditModal(category)`.
The delete button will call `openDeleteModal(category)`.
